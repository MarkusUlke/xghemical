Port of ghemical to cpp 2023


As a new hobby I would like to learn computational chemistry. Found [ghemical](https://www.bioinformatics.org/ghemical/ghemical/index.html) in the web which seems to suit my needs but looks abandoned.
Will try to make it run in cpp 2020(23?) and then to try to read "Introduction to computational chemistry"

Let's see if how this will work out in the next 5-6 years.

# To Do:
- Check mailing list.
- Build cmake wrapper
- Generate doxygen
